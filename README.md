# Design Patterns: Real-World Scenarios

Design patterns are powerful tools in software development, providing reusable solutions to common problems. Below, you'll find a breakdown of **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** design patterns, each demonstrated with real-world scenarios to help you understand their applications.

## üîÅ **Creational Patterns**

### 1. **Singleton**  
**Scenario**: Logging service, configuration manager, database connection pool  
**Purpose**: Ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.  
**Keywords**: global instance, thread-safe, lazy initialization, shared resource

### 2. **Factory Method**  
**Scenario**: OS-specific buttons, notification senders, document readers  
**Purpose**: Define an interface for creating objects, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.  
**Keywords**: object creation, class hierarchy, factory method  

### 3. **Abstract Factory**  
**Scenario**: Cross-platform UI toolkit, themed UI components, device-specific factories  
**Purpose**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
**Keywords**: platform-specific objects, family of products, factory interface  

### 4. **Builder**  
**Scenario**: Meal customization, PDF generation, complex form creation  
**Purpose**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations.  
**Keywords**: complex object creation, step-by-step construction, customizable objects  

### 5. **Prototype**  
**Scenario**: Cloning shapes in a drawing app, game characters, template-based emails  
**Purpose**: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.  
**Keywords**: object cloning, prototype instance, copy mechanism

## üß© **Structural Patterns**

### 6. **Adapter**  
**Scenario**: Legacy payment system integration, converting APIs, third-party service wrappers  
**Purpose**: Convert one interface to another expected by the client, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.  
**Keywords**: interface conversion, compatibility, wrapping  

### 7. **Bridge**  
**Scenario**: UI themes and platforms, shape and rendering logic, remote control devices  
**Purpose**: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation, so the two can vary independently.  
**Keywords**: abstraction, implementation, platform independence  

### 8. **Composite**  
**Scenario**: File system trees, UI component hierarchies, organizational charts  
**Purpose**: Compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  
**Keywords**: hierarchy, part-whole relationships, tree structure  

### 9. **Decorator**  
**Scenario**: Adding borders to windows, logging for services, permission checks  
**Purpose**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing an alternative to subclassing.  
**Keywords**: dynamic behavior, runtime changes, flexible enhancements  

### 10. **Facade**  
**Scenario**: Simplified media player API, startup sequence manager, email sender  
**Purpose**: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying its usage.  
**Keywords**: simplified interface, subsystem coordination, high-level access  

### 11. **Flyweight**  
**Scenario**: Text character rendering, map markers, game terrain tiles  
**Purpose**: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.  
**Keywords**: memory optimization, shared objects, flyweight pattern  

### 12. **Proxy**  
**Scenario**: Image lazy loading, remote object access, permission-controlled access  
**Purpose**: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object.  
**Keywords**: deferred initialization, remote access, control access

## üîÑ **Behavioral Patterns**

### 13. **Chain of Responsibility**  
**Scenario**: Request handling pipeline, log filtering, input validation chain  
**Purpose**: Pass a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which one.  
**Keywords**: request handling, decoupling, handler chain  

### 14. **Command**  
**Scenario**: Undo/redo in editors, UI button actions, scheduled tasks  
**Purpose**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.  
**Keywords**: encapsulate actions, parameterized requests, command object  

### 15. **Mediator**  
**Scenario**: Form field interaction, UI element coordination, chatroom messaging  
**Purpose**: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.  
**Keywords**: centralized communication, decoupling, mediator object  

### 16. **Observer**  
**Scenario**: Stock price notifications, UI refresh, event systems  
**Purpose**: Define a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.  
**Keywords**: event-driven, subscription, state change notification  

### 17. **State**  
**Scenario**: Media player modes, user authentication states, order processing  
**Purpose**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if the object changed its class.  
**Keywords**: state transitions, object behavior, state management  

### 18. **Strategy**  
**Scenario**: Sorting algorithms, payment gateways, compression formats  
**Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.  
**Keywords**: interchangeable algorithms, behavior selection, strategy pattern  

### 19. **Template Method**  
**Scenario**: Report generation, game AI steps, test case setups  
**Purpose**: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in the base class, but let subclasses redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing the structure.  
**Keywords**: code reuse, algorithm steps, base method  

### 20. **Visitor**  
**Scenario**: Tax calculations, syntax tree operations, document exports  
**Purpose**: Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.  
**Keywords**: object structure, external operations, visitor pattern
